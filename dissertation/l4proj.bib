	abstract = {This editorial provides a behavioral science view on gamification and health behavior change, describes its principles and mechanisms, and reviews some of the evidence for its efficacy. Furthermore, this editorial explores the relation between gamification and behavior change frameworks used in the health sciences and shows how gamification principles are closely related to principles that have been proven to work in health behavior change technology. Finally, this editorial provides criteria that can be used to assess when gamification provides a potentially promising framework for digital health interventions. [JMIR Serious Games 2013;1(1):e3]},

	abstract = {We are more connected than ever before. Our smart TVs and refrigerators, phones and drones, online bank accounts and electronic health records, and so much more, are on the web and in the cloud – connected and ‘talking’ to each other. While creating convenience for the end user, this growing interconnected digital footprint creates a ripe surface for a cyber criminal to attack. Just like in some video games, consumers and business leaders find themselves battling the consequences of interconnectivity and are trying to keep opponents from exploiting their information and damaging their reputation. In this “game of protection’ to balance defensive and offensive security techniques, now is the time for CISOs and business leaders to reach for a new cyber security manual – one that leverages gamification. This is the process of exploiting game-like elements to improve information retention and the application of skills, explains Brad Wolfenden of Circadence.},

Today, scholars from fields as diverse as media design, literature, computer science, education, and theatre studies have together contributed to the understanding of this emergent medium and its phenomenon as a learning tool The unsatisfying experience of directly adopting game formats into educational contexts has motivated researchers to study successful (commercial) digital games, in particular to examine the play activities of digital games and the principles underlying the design of digital games in order to develop concepts and strategies for rich virtual learning contexts. In this review, provided is a brief account of academic arguments regarding digital games and learning.},

	abstract = {Meaningful gamification is the use of gameful and playful layers to help a user find personal connections that motivate engagement with a specific context for long-term change. While reward-based gamification can be useful for short-term goals and situations where the participants have no personal connections or intrinsic motivation to engage in a context, rewards can reduce intrinsic motivation and the long-term desire to engage with the real world context. If the goal is long-term change, then rewards should be avoided and other game-based elements used to create a system based on concepts of meaningful gamification. This article introduces six concepts—Reflection, Exposition, Choice, Information, Play, and Engagement—to guide designers of gamification systems that rely on non-reward-based game elements to help people find personal connections and meaning in a real world context.},

We analyze what are the psychological and social motivations of human beings, and how game mechanics can help when it comes to satisfy these needs. Likewise, it is proposed a method for analyzing the effectiveness of gamification based on a quality service model and the metrics associated with the properties of the playability as a measure of fun induced by the process of gamification.},
