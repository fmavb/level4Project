	abstract = {The rapid growth of mobile computing is seriously challenged by the resource constrained mobile devices. However, the growth of mobile computing can be enhanced by integrating mobile computing into cloud computing, and hence a new paradigm of computing called mobile cloud computing emerges. In here, the data is stored in cloud infrastructure and the actual execution is shifted to cloud environment so that a mobile user is set free from resource constrained issue of existing mobile devices. Moreover, to avail the cloud services, the communications between mobile devices and clouds are held through wireless medium. Thus, some new classes of security and privacy challenges are introduced. The purpose of this survey is to present the main security and privacy challenges in this field which have grown much interest among the academia and research community. Although, there are many challenges, corresponding security solutions have been proposed and identified in literature by many researchers to counter the challenges. We also present these recent works in short. Furthermore, we compare these works based on different security and privacy requirements, and finally present open issues.},

Nevertheless, general acceptance of game based learning as a new learning paradigm was deferred by a lack of wellcontrolled, large sample efficacy studies. To address the increasing need of cybersecurity workforce, this paper introduces a game based learning method for high school cybersecurity education. Purdue University Northwest launched GenCyber high school summer camps to about 200 high school students in Chicago metropolitan area. The survey conducted after the summer camp indicated that the game based learning for cybersecurity education was very effective in cybersecurity awareness training. Further analysis of survey data revealed that there is a gender difference in raising students’ interests in cybersecurity and computer science education using game based learning method.},

	abstract = {Game design elements are often implemented in persuasive systems aimed to promote physical activity, a process called ‘‘gamiﬁcation.’’ Gamiﬁcation is believed to motivate users to become more active, and is commonly implemented in commercial products. However, relatively few studies rigorously evaluated the effectiveness of gamiﬁcation, and they yielded contradicting ﬁndings. We set out to evaluate the effectiveness of virtual rewards and social comparison—two game elements prevalent in persuasive systems. We developed a research prototype, called ‘‘StepByStep,’’ aimed to promote routine walking. We created different versions of StepByStep, implemented as an application on Android-based mobile devices, and compared their effectiveness in two ﬁeld studies. Study 1 showed that a quantiﬁed version of the application—offering continuous measurement of walking time, a daily goal, and real-time feedback on progress toward this goal—facilitated reﬂection on activity and signiﬁcantly increased walking time over baseline level. Study 2 showed that gamiﬁed versions offering virtual rewards and social comparison were only as effective as the quantiﬁed version. Thus, we advise designers to facilitate reﬂection on meaningful aspects of physical activity by developing novel ubiquitous measures. Furthermore, our ﬁndings highlight the importance of systematic comparisons between quantiﬁed and gamiﬁed elements for better understanding their motivational affordances.},

As a consequence, data custodians often resort to ad-hoc means to anonymize datasets. Both past and current practices indicate that hashing is often believed to be an effective way to anonymize data. Unfortunately, in practice it is only rarely effective. This paper is a tutorial to explain the limits of cryptographic hash functions as an anonymization technique. Anonymity set is the best privacy model that can be achieved by hash functions. However, this model has several shortcomings. We provide three case studies to illustrate how hashing only yields a weakly anonymized data. The case studies include MAC and email address anonymization as well as the analysis of Google safe browsing.},

We demonstrate that (1) the Popa-Zeldovich model for MKSE does not imply security against either passive or active attacks; (2) Mylar-based Web applications reveal users’ data and queries to passive and active adversarial servers; and (3) Mylar is generically insecure against active attacks due to system design flaws. Our results show that the problem of securing client-server applications against actively malicious servers is challenging and still unsolved. We conclude with general lessons for the designers of systems that rely on property-preserving or searchable encryption to protect data from untrusted servers.},

	title = {Comparing the {Usability} of {Cryptographic} {APIs}},
	doi = {10.1109/SP.2017.52},
	abstract = {Potentially dangerous cryptography errors are well-documented in many applications. Conventional wisdom suggests that many of these errors are caused by cryptographic Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) that are too complicated, have insecure defaults, or are poorly documented. To address this problem, researchers have created several cryptographic libraries that they claim are more usable, however, none of these libraries have been empirically evaluated for their ability to promote more secure development. This paper is the first to examine both how and why the design and resulting usability of different cryptographic libraries affects the security of code written with them, with the goal of understanding how to build effective future libraries. We conducted a controlled experiment in which 256 Python developers recruited from GitHub attempt common tasks involving symmetric and asymmetric cryptography using one of five different APIs. We examine their resulting code for functional correctness and security, and compare their results to their self-reported sentiment about their assigned library. Our results suggest that while APIs designed for simplicity can provide security benefits - reducing the decision space, as expected, prevents choice of insecure parameters - simplicity is not enough. Poor documentation, missing code examples, and a lack of auxiliary features such as secure key storage, caused even participants assigned to simplified libraries to struggle with both basic functional correctness and security. Surprisingly, the availability of comprehensive documentation and easy-to-use code examples seems to compensate for more complicated APIs in terms of functionally correct results and participant reactions, however, this did not extend to security results. We find it particularly concerning that for about 20\% of functionally correct tasks, across libraries, participants believed their code was secure when it was not. Our results suggest that while new cryptographic libraries that want to promote effective security should offer a simple, convenient interface, this is not enough: they should also, and perhaps more importantly, ensure support for a broad range of common tasks and provide accessible documentation with secure, easy-to-use code examples.},

However, end-users are not the only ones who have usability problems with passwords! Developers who are tasked with writing the code by which passwords are stored must do so securely. Yet history has shown that this complex task often fails due to human error with catastrophic results. While an end-user who selects a bad password can have dire consequences, the consequences of a developer who forgets to hash and salt a password database can lead to far larger problems. In this paper we present a first qualitative usability study with 20 computer science students to discover how developers deal with password storage and to inform research into aiding developers in the creation of secure password systems.},

While reward-based gamification can be useful for short-term goals and situations where the participants have no personal connections or intrinsic motivation to engage in a context, rewards can reduce intrinsic motivation and the long-term desire to engage with the real world context. If the goal is long-term change, then rewards should be avoided and other game-based elements used to create a system based on concepts of meaningful gamification. This article introduces six concepts—Reflection, Exposition, Choice, Information, Play, and Engagement—to guide designers of gamification systems that rely on non-reward-based game elements to help people find personal connections and meaning in a real world context.},

Further, serious games allow learners to experience situations that are impossible in the real world for reasons of safety, cost, time, etc., but they are also claimed to have positive impacts on the players’ development of a number of different skills. Subsequently, some possible positive (and negative) impacts of serious games are discussed. Further, some of the markets such games are used in are considered here, including, military games, government games, educational games, corporate games, and healthcare games. This report also identifies some (mainly academic) actors in the North American and the European serious games market.

	abstract = {In recent years, so-called serious games, where some kind of knowledge is gained through digital game play, have received significant attention and there has been an active movement toward games that effectively enrich the learning environment. Serious games are games that are developed according to the concept, “It is possible through game play to obtain some kind of knowledge while having fun. Through these serious games, there has been an active movement toward fun learning using games in education at school and internal training at organizations. In contrast, at universities the level of learning programming differs significantly depending on the academic background of the student and there are issues with traditional programming education learning because the student does not feel enjoyment and is not interested in information engineering. As a countermeasure, teaching methods and teaching aids etc. have been cited as themes and learning through the utilization of serious games and game development has been proposed to tackle these themes. In this paper we propose and evaluate serious games for programming learning based on the concept “Learning programming through gaming”.},
