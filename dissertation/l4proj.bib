	abstract = {In recent years, so-called serious games, where some kind of knowledge is gained through digital game play, have received significant attention and there has been an active movement toward games that effectively enrich the learning environment. Serious games are games that are developed according to the concept, {\textquotedblleft}It is possible through game play to obtain some kind of knowledge while having fun. Through these serious games, there has been an active movement toward fun learning using games in education at school and internal training at organizations. In contrast, at universities the level of learning programming differs significantly depending on the academic background of the student and there are issues with traditional programming education learning because the student does not feel enjoyment and is not interested in information engineering. As a countermeasure, teaching methods and teaching aids etc. have been cited as themes and learning through the utilization of serious games and game development has been proposed to tackle these themes. In this paper we propose and evaluate serious games for programming learning based on the concept {\textquotedblleft}Learning programming through gaming{\textquotedblright}.},

Some excellent prescriptive software process simulation games have been created, as well as a few software engineering drill and practice games. In general, these games do not allow students to create agile process models or experiment with process improvement strategies. We are creating a serious game that will serve as a virtual learning environment to allow students to explore agile process improvement practices. Our game is designed as a single-player game where the player takes the role of software team leader and plays against an AI (artificial intelligence) opponent representing the customer's interests and needs. Players are rewarded for developing project strategies that allow for completion of projects on time, within budget, and meet the necessary software quality requirements. It is our intention to create a game with sufficiently detailed instructions to allow instructors to introduce hands on practice with agile process improvement activities without requiring additional class time.},

	abstract = {Passwords are still a mainstay of various security systems, as well as the cause of many usability issues. For end-users, many of these issues have been studied extensively, highlighting problems and informing design decisions for better policies and motivating research into alternatives. However, end-users are not the only ones who have usability problems with passwords! Developers who are tasked with writing the code by which passwords are stored must do so securely. Yet history has shown that this complex task often fails due to human error with catastrophic results. While an end-user who selects a bad password can have dire consequences, the consequences of a developer who forgets to hash and salt a password database can lead to far larger problems. In this paper we present a first qualitative usability study with 20 computer science students to discover how developers deal with password storage and to inform research into aiding developers in the creation of secure password systems.},

	doi = {10.1109/SP.2017.52},
	abstract = {Potentially dangerous cryptography errors are well-documented in many applications. Conventional wisdom suggests that many of these errors are caused by cryptographic Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) that are too complicated, have insecure defaults, or are poorly documented. To address this problem, researchers have created several cryptographic libraries that they claim are more usable, however, none of these libraries have been empirically evaluated for their ability to promote more secure development. This paper is the first to examine both how and why the design and resulting usability of different cryptographic libraries affects the security of code written with them, with the goal of understanding how to build effective future libraries. We conducted a controlled experiment in which 256 Python developers recruited from GitHub attempt common tasks involving symmetric and asymmetric cryptography using one of five different APIs. We examine their resulting code for functional correctness and security, and compare their results to their self-reported sentiment about their assigned library. Our results suggest that while APIs designed for simplicity can provide security benefits - reducing the decision space, as expected, prevents choice of insecure parameters - simplicity is not enough. Poor documentation, missing code examples, and a lack of auxiliary features such as secure key storage, caused even participants assigned to simplified libraries to struggle with both basic functional correctness and security. Surprisingly, the availability of comprehensive documentation and easy-to-use code examples seems to compensate for more complicated APIs in terms of functionally correct results and participant reactions, however, this did not extend to security results. We find it particularly concerning that for about 20\% of functionally correct tasks, across libraries, participants believed their code was secure when it was not. Our results suggest that while new cryptographic libraries that want to promote effective security should offer a simple, convenient interface, this is not enough: they should also, and perhaps more importantly, ensure support for a broad range of common tasks and provide accessible documentation with secure, easy-to-use code examples.},

This paper presents a systematic study of cryptographic vulnerabilities in practice, an examination of state-of-the-art techniques to prevent such vulnerabilities, and a discussion of open problems and possible future research directions. Our study covers 269 cryptographic vulnerabilities reported in the CVE database from January 2011 to May 2014. The results show that just 17\% of the bugs are in cryptographic libraries (which often have devastating consequences), and the remaining 83\% are misuses of cryptographic libraries by individual applications. We observe that preventing bugs in different parts of a system requires different techniques, and that no effective techniques exist to deal with certain classes of mistakes, such as weak key generation.},

As a consequence, data custodians often resort to ad-hoc means to anonymize datasets. Both past and current practices indicate that hashing is often believed to be an effective way to anonymize data. Unfortunately, in practice it is only rarely effective. This paper is a tutorial to explain the limits of cryptographic hash functions as an anonymization technique. Anonymity set is the best privacy model that can be achieved by hash functions. However, this model has several shortcomings. We provide three case studies to illustrate how hashing only yields a weakly anonymized data. The case studies include MAC and email address anonymization as well as the analysis of Google safe browsing.},

The use of IT can help overcoming this challenge by increasing the interaction in large-scale lectures without massively increasing the workload of lecturers. In this research-in-progress paper, we present the design and pre-test of a mobile-learning application aiming to increase the interaction in large-scale lectures and the learning success of learners. For designing our application, we follow a design science research approach. We rely on insights from interaction theory as well as requirements gathered from lecturers and students in a focus group workshop. A pre-test of our application showed high values for Perceived Usefulness, User Satisfaction, and Perceived Presentation Quality for the overall application and moreover high values for Performance Expectancy and Intention to Use of all but one functions. The results show that the application is ready for being used in large-scale lectures. As a next step, the application will be used in one of our large-scale lectures aiming to evaluate whether using our application has a positive impact on interaction, satisfaction and learning success.},

	abstract = {In this chapter, we describe the methodology we have engineered during the design process of the collaborative and immersive learning game 3D Virtual Operating Room. The game targets an audience of practitioners involved in the operating room and the training consists in virtually re-enacting typical perioperative activities so as to learn or improve skills related to patient safety. The challenges faced in this project include multiplayer collaboration in a shared, interactive and dynamically evolving virtual environment, and modelling educational scenarios on the basis of actual observations inside the operating room. The model we detail is grounded on a semantic definition of the environment which allowed for three innovative features. A game-mediated communication system where information pertaining to the game is exchanged in real time by the players. AI-controlled characters replacing missing players as fully equal partners. And, the ability for the game to provide feedback in real time or during a debriefing on the team{\textquoteright}s performance against predefined pedagogical objectives.},

	abstract = {This paper aims to investigate how a gamified learning approach influences science learning, achievement and motivation, through a context-aware mobile learning environment, and explains the effects on motivation and student learning. A series of gamified learning activities, based on MGLS (Mobile Gamification Learning System), was developed and implemented in an elementary school science curriculum to improve student motivation and to help students engage more actively in their learning activities. The responses to our questionnaire indicate that students valued the outdoor learning activities made possible by the use of a smartphone and its functions. Pre- and post-test results demonstrated that incorporating mobile and gamification technologies into a botanical learning process could achieve a better learning performance and a higher degree of motivation than either non-gamified mobile learning or traditional instruction. Further, they revealed a positive relationship between learning achievement and motivation. The correlation coefficient for ARCS dimensions and post-test shows that the ARCS-A (attention) is greater than ARCS-R, ARCS-C and ARCS-S. This means that the attention (ARCS-A) of this system is an important dimension in this research. The results could provide parents, teachers and educational organizations with the necessary data to make more relevant educational decision.},
